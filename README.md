Example : 

Business Problem : This analysis focuses on identifying **top and bottom-selling pizzas** and **peak sales periods** (weekends/evenings) for menu optimization and resource allocation, while also leveraging **customer preferences** (Large size, Classic category) for targeted marketing and inventory planning.

Key Questions Such As:
* What is total revenue Generated?
* How many pizzas were sold in total?
* Which Category and size of pizzas perform best?
* Which pizzas are the Top & Bottom Performers?
* What is the Avg Order Value & Avg Pizzas Per Order?

7. Business Impacts & Insights:
* Menu Profitability & Efficiency	: The Brie Carre Pizza is a major drain on resources and menu space as the worst seller. Conversely, the Thai Chicken Pizza drives the highest revenue, indicating strong premium pricing potential.
* Operational & Staffing Optimization :	Concentrating resources on Weekends (Fri/Sat) and Evenings is critical. Staffing, inventory, and marketing spend should peak during these times to capture maximum demand.
* Inventory Management & Waste Reduction : 	High demand for Large Size pizzas and the Classic Category necessitates maintaining high stock levels for these specific ingredients, while ingredients for the worst sellers can be significantly reduced, minimizing spoilage.
* Marketing Strategy & Campaign:  Focus	Marketing efforts should heavily feature the successful Classic Category and promote the Large Size pizza as the default/best value option, leveraging established customer preference for higher order values.
* Revenue Stability	: The sales peaks in July and January suggest seasonal promotions or events may be driving demand. Understanding these specific drivers can help stabilize revenue throughout the year, especially during the lower months (e.g., September/October).
